    //**Part 1:** Build your own array of all of the prime numbers up to 100, and store that array in a text file `primearray.txt`
    //in the `answers` directory. **Save your project files in the `answers` directory**. 
    //**Part 2:** Have the class ` Consecutive` take an array of integers from `primearr.txt` and return the minimum number of
    //integers needed to make the contents of the array consecutive from the lowest number to the highest number. 
    //For example: If `arr` contains `[4, 8, 6]` then the output should be 2, 
    //because two numbers need to be added to the array (5 and 7) to make it a consecutive array of numbers from 4 to 8. 
    //Print out the answers for arrays of the first 5 primes, the first 10 primes, the first 50 primes, and the first 100 prime numbers 
    //on separate lines.
